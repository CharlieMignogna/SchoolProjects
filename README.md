# SchoolProjects
just a catalog of projects ive done so far and am proud of!
card.java, hand.java, deck.java, cardpile.java, Ai.java, BiggestCardAi.java, SmallestCardAi.java, UnoWarMatch.java, and Tournament.java work together to simulate thousands of games of UnoWar(just the rules of uno and war combined) played by Ai using diffrent strategies and calculating each Ai's win percentage
HuffmanCodeBook.java, HuffmanNode.java, and HuffmanCodeTree.java work together to make a binary to string decoder using the Huffman binary search tree, along with this the HuffmanCodeBook can be used to encode strings into binary(once again using the Huffman method of ranging bit ammounts)
